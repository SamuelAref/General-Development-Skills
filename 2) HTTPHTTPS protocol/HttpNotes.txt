
HTTP, HTTPS and SSL

    HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol 

        - used for viewing web pages on the internet
        - in standard HTTP, all information is sent in clear text 
        - Vulnerable to hackers, like passwords and personal info 
        - this is why HTTPS was developed

   HTTPS - Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol

        - HTTP with a security feature 
        - Encrypts the data that is being retrieved by HTTP 
        - Uses encryption algorithms to scramble the data that's being transferred 
        - protects the data by 2 protocols 

            SSL - Secure Sockets Layer 

                - Protocol that is used to ensure security on the internet.
                - uses public key encryption to secure data.

                How it works 

                    - when we request a website, our browser will request an ssl certificate 
                    - if it is supplied then secure info can be transferred 

            TLS - Transport Layer security

                - The latest industry standard cryptographic protocol.
                - The successor to SSL
                - Authenticates the server,client, and encrypts the data
